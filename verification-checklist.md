## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Jenkins Build

- [ ] Changes appear on live website within 2-3 minutes

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/
# Should show: index.html, main.css, script.js
```

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Deployment Successful When:**
- Jenkins build shows green/success status

- CSS and JavaScript work correctly
- Automatic deployments trigger on code changes
- S3 bucket contains all website files
